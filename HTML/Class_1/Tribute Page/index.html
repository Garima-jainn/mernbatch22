    <P>Ratan Tata was the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamshedji Tata, the founder of the
        Tata Group. He graduated from Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in
        architecture.[6] He had also attended the Harvard Business School (HBS) Advanced Management Program in 1975.[2]
        He joined the Tata Group in 1962,[7] starting on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata
        as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. During his tenure, the Tata Group acquired
        Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a
        global business.

        Throughout his life, Tata invested in over 40 start-ups, primarily in a personal capacity, with additional
        investments through his firm, RNT Capital Advisors.
